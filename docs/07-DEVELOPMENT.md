# Development
I'm working with Windows 10 an the Hyper-V-Manager to run a Virtual Machine.
This Setup was developed on a Ubuntu Bionic Server. My Console under Windows
is the Git Bash (MingW64).
 
My IDE (Php-Storm, Intelli J) can do a SFTP-Sync with the VM.
So i'm uploading instantly on file change.
